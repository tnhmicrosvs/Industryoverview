
  DEVOPS CI/CD with Microservices - Enterprise Grade 
  ==================================================

step 1
------

  select Microservices as the Software Architecture

  Select Microservices as the Architectural pattern

  Start developing the RESTful services with selected Microservices  Design patterns like  Circuit breaker, Discovery Server, API gateway etc.

Step 2
------

  Develop the CI / CD infrastructure for pipeline flow

       Components of the Infrastructure
       --------------------------------

     Code Repo with Version control
     Code inspection tools 
     Static or dynamic Analysis for Security best practices
     Code Quality testing with quality gates
     Build server (CI - Server)
     Cloud provider (AWS / GCP / Oracle Azure)
     Image Repository to store Container images per microservice basis
     Persistent Storage
     Container Orchestration Platform (K8, DCOS, Nomad, Docker Swarm)
     Artifactory Store
     Deployment server
     Monitoring 
     Tracking with logs
     Dashboard Reporting (operational / analytical)
       


Step 3
------

  once the CI / CD infra is ready it is time to start developing the builds

 as the dev team checks in the code to the Code Repo the code should go through all
the steps utilizing the components mentioned in the above infra

 A sample work through given below 

  code commits to code repo --> Build server detects it as a poll with in the 
schedule time --- > code inspection takes place -- > Code analysis for Security
 takes place -- > quality testing takes -- > upon passing all quality gates -->
 a build comes out (Jar / WAR) -- > wrap the build and generate the image -->
 push the image-to-Image Repo ---> Deployment (running the image and bring the container up)
 will be taken care by the orchestration platform --> microservices app will be 
 accessible to the end user or client
